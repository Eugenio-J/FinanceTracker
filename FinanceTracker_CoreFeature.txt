Core Features (Based on My Workflow)
1. Account Management
Track multiple accounts with current balances:
	• Unionbank (Payroll)
	• Maribank (Hub account)
	• GCash (Parking payments)
	• Maya (Savings)
	• BPI (Cash withdrawals)
2. Salary Distribution Tracking
Every bi-weekly cycle, record:
	• Salary amount received in Unionbank
	• Transfers to Maribank (with date and amount)
	• From Maribank, track splits to: 
		○ GCash (parking fund)
		○ Maya (savings target)
		○ Remaining balance (for Shopee, insurance)
	• Transfer to BPI (cash holdings)
Key requirement: Auto-calculate remaining balance after each transfer
3. Expense Tracking
	• Manual expense entry with: 
		○ Date, amount, category, account used, description
		○ Categories: Parking, Shopee, Insurance, Cash expenses, Food, Transport, etc.
	• Monthly expense summary by category and account
	• Compare actual vs planned distribution
4. Dashboard Views
	• Current balance across all accounts
	• Next salary date countdown (bi-weekly schedule)
	• Month-to-date expenses by category
	• Salary distribution history (last 6 cycles)
